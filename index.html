            <h3><a href="https://github.com/JakeSeiberg/FormulaStats">FormulaStats</a></h3>
            <p>FormulaStats is an iOS application I developed that allows users to search and compare any two drivers who have ever competed in Formula One. The app fetches data from the Ergast API using network calls and completion handlers. Written entirely in Swift, this project is still under development.</p>
            
            <h3><a href="https://github.com/JakeSeiberg/UOHackathon">Weather App</a></h3>
            <p>During a 24-hour hackathon, I collaborated with a team to develop a real-time weather application. This app enables users to search their location and receive current weather data along with a weekly forecast. The project, written in Python, utilizes the National Weather Service API to retrieve real-time weather information.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <div class="interests">
            <p>I love software engineering and enjoy working with Python, C++, and C#. Each language has its own strengths: Python is great for quick development and data analysis, C++ is powerful for system programming, and C# is excellent for building applications both large and small. I also like keeping up with new developments in computer science, whether it's AI, new programming methods, or emerging technologies. Staying updated helps me grow as a software engineer.<p>
